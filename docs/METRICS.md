# Metric Definitions

Every figure on the site must trace to a definition here. Each chart's
"how is this calculated" disclosure renders straight from this file.

## Grain

Three grains, never mixed in one series without an explicit label.

- **Flow** — events in a month. True first registrations
  (`registrations_flow`, from the Stats NZ TPT series) and ownership
  changes. Denominator: all events of the same dataset in the same month.
- **Survivors** — `registrations_surviving`: *vehicles first registered in
  month M that are still registered as at the snapshot date.* Render that
  sentence on every chart that uses this dataset or its subsets (`nz_new`,
  `used_imports`). Denominator: all surviving vehicles first registered in
  the same month. Recent months are close to complete; older months shrink
  with every snapshot as vehicles are scrapped. **Never put a survivors
  series and a flow series on the same chart.**
- **Stock** — vehicles registered at month end. Denominator: all vehicles
  in the fleet at that month end.

## Scope

Every dataset counts **in-scope rows only**. A row is in scope when its
vehicle type is `in_scope` in `vehicle_scope.csv` (today: passenger cars
and vans, and goods vans, utes and trucks) and its import status is
`in_scope` in `import_status_map.csv`. Datasets that measure entry to the
fleet also require `counts_as_fleet_entry`. Every guardrail rate (unmapped
makes, unmapped powertrains, row-count movement) is measured on in-scope
rows. Out-of-scope rows stay in the archived snapshot aggregates with their
scope flag; they never reach the cube.

## Core measures

| Measure | Definition |
|---|---|
| Count | Number of vehicles matching the filters in the period. |
| Share | Count ÷ count of all vehicles in the same dataset and month. Suppressed when the denominator is under 200. |
| Change on a year ago | (this month − same month last year) ÷ same month last year. Suppressed when the base is under 50. |
| 12-month running total | Sum of the trailing 12 months inclusive of the current month. |

**Share changes are always expressed in percentage points.** 10% to 15% is
+5pp. Enforce in the formatter, not per chart.

## Derived measures

**Top-5 share** — combined share of the five largest values of a dimension
in that month. Membership is recomputed monthly, so the line reflects
concentration rather than the fortunes of a fixed five.

**Median import age** — median of (first NZ registration year − vehicle
year) across **used imports only**, over the trailing 12 months. Whole
years; never a decimal. NZ-new vehicles are excluded: their age at
registration is 0 by construction from 2007 (MODEL_AND_AGE.md §1), so
including them would restate the new/used mix rather than measure age.

**Mean fuel consumption** — mean combined fuel consumption (L/100km)
across vehicles with a combustion engine (`has_combustion_engine` in
`powertrain_map.csv`), excluding missing, unparseable and out-of-range
values (above 60 L/100km). Coverage is vehicles with a valid value ÷
vehicles with an engine; do not publish months with under 70% coverage.
Vehicles without an engine are outside both numerator and denominator, so
the figure describes vehicles that burn fuel and the chart says so; a
rising EV share neither drags it towards zero nor suppresses it. The
register has no CO2 field, and CO2 is never estimated from fuel
consumption: the conversion depends on the fuel and would be our
assumption presented as data.

**Mean fleet age** — (snapshot year − vehicle year), volume-weighted, across
the fleet. Report median alongside the mean; the distribution has a long
tail and the mean alone misleads.

**Cohort survival** — of vehicles first registered in month or year C, the
share still registered at a later snapshot: survivors(C, t) ÷
survivors(C, t₀), where t₀ is the first snapshot in which the cohort was
observed. Computed from the archived `registrations_surviving` aggregates
in `data/snapshots/`, not by joining vehicles: the register carries no
stable vehicle identity, so a vehicle that leaves and returns cannot be
told apart from one that stayed. Scrappage in a period is the fall in a
cohort's survivors between consecutive snapshots. Survival relative to the
*original* registration count needs `registrations_flow` as the base.
Every survival figure states its base and its first observed snapshot.

**Per capita** — registrations per 1,000 residents, using Stats NZ
subnational population estimates. Population is a separate reference file
with its own vintage; label the estimate year on the chart.

## Estimation rules

- Never interpolate a missing month. Render a gap.
- Never extrapolate beyond the latest snapshot.
- Suppress rather than round to zero.
- Any figure the user could mistake for official must carry the basis note:
  *"Registrations recorded by NZTA. Not the same as vehicle sales."*
