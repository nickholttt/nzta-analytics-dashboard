# Decisions

Append-only. Never edit or delete an entry. If a decision changes, add a new entry that supersedes
the old one and names it by number.

Every entry states its **basis**:

- **commit**: taken from that commit's message and the files it changed, read on 2026-09-13.
- **doc**: taken from the named file in this repo.
- **user (Claude memory)**: the user said it to Claude in an earlier session. It was recorded only in
  Claude's private memory and appears in the repo for the first time here. Treat it as true, but
  confirm with the user before relying on it for something irreversible.
- **inferred — confirm**: reconstructed from a commit subject alone, with no stated rationale.

New entries use this template:

```

```

---

## D-001 2026-09-11 — The starter kit is the specification
- Agent: user
- Basis: commit 33e92c6; doc CLAUDE.md, README.md
- Decision: CLAUDE.md's seven design invariants, the five shapes, the stack and the build order govern
  the project. Domain knowledge lives in `data/reference/*.csv` and `config/*.json`, never in code.
- Consequences: `pipeline/tests/test_invariants.py` scans `pipeline/*.py` for hardcoded domain values.

## D-002 2026-09-11 — LF line endings everywhere; parquet is binary
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commit 9e57a61
- Context: the pipeline and golden-file tests run on Linux. A Windows checkout with autocrlf could make
  a golden file differ from what CI sees.
- Decision: `.gitattributes` sets `* text=auto eol=lf` and `*.parquet binary`.

## D-003 2026-09-11 — Reference maps keyed on NZTA's actual spellings; no SUV segment
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commits 77ad55f, 1d6bd2d
- Context: the seed maps matched no rows. SUVs are recorded as station wagons, HEIGHT is 0 on passenger
  rows, and CLASS MC was tested as a proxy and rejected.
- Decision: `segment_map.csv` is coarse (Car / Ute / Van / Truck / Other) and has no SUV segment.

## D-004 2026-09-11 — The snapshot measures survivors, so it is named registrations_surviving
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commit 22eca15
- Context: the register holds only vehicles still registered, so grouping it by first-registration
  month counts survivors, not registrations.
- Decision: `first_registrations` is renamed `registrations_surviving`. `registrations_flow` (Stats NZ
  TPT) is added as build step 1b. `volume-trend` moves to `registrations_flow`, because a survivors
  count shrinks the past.

## D-005 2026-09-11 — Age measures scoped to used imports
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commit 8d106be
- Context: NZ-new age at registration is 0 by construction from 2007.
- Decision: `genuinely_new_share` and `freshness` are deleted, and `median_import_age` applies to
  `used_imports` only.

## D-006 2026-09-11 — Pipeline design: Python + DuckDB, staged, publish only if every guardrail passes
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commits 6298234, 6010b05
- Decision: `python -m pipeline {init-schema | run | build}`. The pull is paged by OBJECTID ranges and
  ingested one page at a time into a disk-backed DuckDB. Everything is written to `data/staging/`
  first; `public/data`, the snapshot archive and `data/state` are written only when every guardrail
  passes. `pipeline/expected_schema.json` is captured once and asserted on every run.
- Consequences: the cube contract in `docs/CUBE_SCHEMA.md` is locked by
  `pipeline/tests/test_golden.py`.

## D-007 2026-09-11 — Monthly GitHub Actions run on the 8th, committing snapshot and state
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commits 8435869, 97e6297, 5599d3e; doc `.github/workflows/monthly-build.yml`
- Context: NZTA last edited the 2026-08 snapshot on 3 September. The 8th leaves a margin, and a later
  refresh makes a run skip rather than fail.
- Decision: cron `17 6 8 * *`. The run skips when the change key is unchanged. On a build it commits
  `data/snapshots/` and `data/state/` as github-actions[bot] with `[skip ci]`. Peak memory is
  recorded on every run.

## D-008 2026-09-11 — Trailing-12-month unmapped guards for make and powertrain
- Agent: claude
- Basis: inferred — confirm (commit 0093e69 subject only; rationale not read)
- Decision: make and powertrain carry an unmapped-rate guard over the trailing 12 months as well as
  the all-time guard.

## D-009 2026-09-11 — Brand promotions: recording artefacts in every year, genuine splits from the split year
- Agent: claude, approved by user
- Basis: commits 3628f76, 9e4c9e9, efbe4ef, 40932ba; approval from user (Claude memory)
- Decision: MINI, LEXUS, INFINITI, ABARTH and JEEP (under CHRYSLER) are promoted in every vehicle
  year. Genuine brand splits apply only from the split year: RAM >= 2011, FUSO >= 2003, UD >= 2010,
  ALPINE >= 2017, GENESIS >= 2017 (used imports only). `model_registry.csv` holds exceptions only.

## D-010 2026-09-12 — Mild hybrids identified by nameplate in their own reference file
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commits 3d730f7, 8bf272c, 28bbd60
- Context: NZTA's hybrid codes don't say mild or full, and three model_registry rules had caught about
  a third of mild hybrids while the category looked complete.
- Decision: `mild_hybrid_models.csv` classifies nameplates as mild, full or unresolved, with a basis
  and a confidence. Identification coverage is published at stated and high-confidence-only levels,
  with a warning below 70% trailing. Subaru e-Boxer stays unresolved.

## D-011 2026-09-12 — Brand ownership is "as at today", not versioned; as_at records verification
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commits 5258d20, c5623ba; doc README.md §Maintenance
- Decision: FUSO and HINO belong to ARCHION from 1 April 2026. Ownership is not versioned over time,
  and the `as_at` column records when a row was last checked (a blank means never checked). A
  non-ISO `as_at` aborts the build.

## D-012 2026-09-12 — GitHub Actions moved to Node 24 versions
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commit 6805cf3; comment in `.github/workflows/monthly-build.yml`
- Context: GitHub removes Node 20 from its runners on 23 September 2026.

## D-013 2026-09-12 — Freeze until the unattended-run gate; deferred work lives in POST_GATE.md
- Agent: user
- Basis: commit 006fb8d; doc POST_GATE.md; freeze extent from user (Claude memory)
- Decision: the gate is the scheduled runs on 8 October and 8 November 2026 completing clean and
  unattended. Until both pass, pipeline code, the workflow, the cube schema, tests and reference data
  are frozen. Work that touches them is logged in `POST_GATE.md` (Part A cube changes, then the Part
  B build fixes).

## D-014 2026-09-12 — A local reference UI before the gate
- Agent: claude, at the user's direction
- Basis: commit d788e41; direction from user (Claude memory)
- Decision: Astro + React islands + Observable Plot at the repo root, dev server only (no deploy),
  reading `public/data`. Three renderers (mix, trend, distribution) are chosen by the shape inferred
  from measure and dimension.
- Consequences: this runs ahead of CLAUDE.md's build order, which says to prove two unattended runs
  before building any UI and to render only mix and trend at step 3. See the contradictions listed
  under Blocked in `docs/STATE.md`.

## D-015 2026-09-12 — The share measure has two suppression guards
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commit 2fae3f1; doc docs/METRICS.md §Two suppression guards
- Context: in April 2020 Hyundai Motor Group showed 16.9% on a denominator of 1,542. It cleared the
  200-vehicle floor, but the month was unrepresentative (lockdown), not imprecise.
- Decision: `min_denominator` 200 (precision) and `min_share_of_trailing_median` 0.33
  (representativeness). A month trips on either. The argument lives in METRICS.md so nobody removes
  the second guard as redundant.

## D-016 2026-09-12 — Every preset carries status and requires; the UI cross-checks them
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commit dff061f; doc `config/presets.json` `$status`
- Decision: status is `live`, `blocked` or `invalid`, and `requires` names every outstanding
  deliverable. The UI shows a disagreement between authored status and what the cube resolves as a
  warning. When a dataset lands, re-run the triage before building the chart.

## D-017 2026-09-12 — Mix-chart defaults are driven by config
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commit f4256fa
- Decision: top-N ranked over the trailing window. Trailing (rolling) share is the default, with
  monthly as a toggle. The default start is the first sustained multi-category month (thresholds in
  `presets.json` `mix_default_start`). Event markers go in lanes.

## D-018 2026-09-12 — Derived measures render through the existing five shapes via a registry
- Agent: claude
- Basis: commit 1d1d0ed
- Decision: derived series are registered by measure id in `src/lib/derived.ts`, and
  `src/lib/resolve.ts` reads that registry, so a derived measure without a renderer reports as blocked.
  `top_5_share` (the concentration chart) was the first. No sixth renderer.

## D-019 2026-09-12 — POST_GATE Part A ordering
- Agent: user
- Basis: commit 5da1acf; doc POST_GATE.md (working tree, uncommitted as of 2026-09-13)
- Decision: A1 pair slice `import_status` x `age_at_registration_band` first after 8 November. The
  uncommitted working tree inserts A2 (step 1b `registrations_flow`, the unlock for cohort survival)
  and moves the `segment_group` promotion to A3.

## D-020 2026-09-13 — UI work continues on ui/explore with a hard boundary; canon cut from 26 to 9
- Agent: user
- Basis: user (Claude memory). Not yet reflected in `config/presets.json`, which still holds 26 presets.
- Decision: branch `ui/explore`. Out of bounds on it: `pipeline/`, `.github/workflows/`,
  `config/dimensions.json`, `config/measures.json`, `data/reference/*`, `public/data` contents.
  `config/presets.json` is in bounds (the pipeline, workflow and tests never read it). Planned canon:
  Tier 1 brand-owner-origin, powertrain-mix, new-vs-used, used-import-age; Tier 2 brand-share merged
  with parent-group-share, concentration, segment-mix; Tier 3 age-distribution-moving-hole,
  cohort-survival. Cut: engine-size, regional-volume, regional-age, regional-powertrain, model-league,
  shaken-clock, pipeline-lag.
- Note: `shaken-clock` is not an id in the current `presets.json`. Confirm what it refers to.

## D-021 2026-09-13 — Design system: Source Serif 4 + IBM Plex Sans, 8-colour line palette
- Agent: claude, at the user's direction
- Basis: user (Claude memory); uncommitted working tree (`src/lib/theme.ts`, `src/styles/site.css`,
  `package.json`)
- Decision: questions are set in Source Serif 4 and everything else in IBM Plex Sans (via
  `@fontsource-variable`). Paper `#f8f7f3`. Eight line colours; series past eight are grey context
  lines. The first `colour_slots_by_trailing` (5) slots go by trailing share, the rest by peak share.
- Status: shown for review, not approved or committed as of 2026-09-13.

## D-022 2026-09-13 — GitHub API access through the gh CLI only
- Agent: user
- Basis: user (Claude memory)
- Decision: use `gh` (`C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`, not on the Git Bash PATH) for runs, logs
  and dispatch. Never extract or use the Git Credential Manager token. Confirm before pushing to main
  during the freeze.

## D-023 2026-09-13 — Shared agent protocol for Claude Code and Gemini
- Agent: claude, at the user's direction
- Basis: this commit
- Decision: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/STATE.md`, this file and `docs/playbooks/` are the shared context. The
  global protocol lives between `BEGIN/END SHARED AGENT PROTOCOL` markers in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and
  `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`. `.claude/skills/*` are thin wrappers over the playbooks.

## D-024 2026-09-13 — Reasons for the canon cut in D-020
- Agent: user
- Basis: user (Claude memory)
- Decision: the presets D-020 cuts, and why:
  - `engine-size`: cut (no reason recorded beyond the cut).
  - `regional-volume`, `regional-age`, `regional-powertrain`: the TLA is the owner's current address,
    not where the vehicle was registered.
  - `model-league`: survivors data with 68% all-time model coverage. It comes back with step 1b
    (`registrations_flow`).
  - `shaken-clock`: its prediction was wrong; fold what remains into `used-import-age`.
  - `pipeline-lag`: fragile.
- Also in D-020: `brand-share` and `parent-group-share` merge behind a granularity toggle, and
  `segment-mix` is retitled honestly, because SUV is not answerable (D-003).

## D-025 2026-09-13 — UI work on ui/explore handed to Gemini
- Agent: user
- Basis: user instruction in the Claude session of 2026-09-13
- Decision: the user continues the UI steps (docs/STATE.md, Next up) with Gemini, starting from
  Claude's uncommitted design step. Claude does not edit those files unless handed them back.

## D-026 2026-10-19 — Adopt docs/CHECKPOINT.md; keep decisions in this one file
- Agent: claude
- Basis: global protocol `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, version 2026-10-12
- Context: the global protocol was revised on 2026-10-12. It adds `docs/CHECKPOINT.md` (the
  handoff and the only home of the work queue), makes `docs/STATE.md` a snapshot under 150 lines,
  and expects one decision record per file under `docs/decisions/`.
- Options considered: (1) adopt all three, migrating D-001..D-025 into `docs/decisions/`;
  (2) adopt CHECKPOINT.md and the STATE.md shape, keep this single append-only file;
  (3) change nothing. (1) rewrites 25 records whose bases cite this file, and the protocol lets a
  repo relax a global rule. (3) leaves the repo out of step with the protocol both agents now read.
- Decision: (2). New records keep this file's template. STATE.md was rewritten as a snapshot; its
  "Next up" moved to CHECKPOINT.md.
- Consequences: Gemini should read CHECKPOINT.md for the queue. Moving to `docs/decisions/` later
  is a mechanical split.
- Status: decided by Claude (unreviewed)

## D-027 2026-10-19 — UI work on ui/explore returns to Claude; agents may push their own branches
- Agent: user
- Basis: user instruction in the Claude session of 2026-10-19
- Decision: supersedes D-025. Claude now owns the UI files on `ui/explore`, starting with the
  review findings in `docs/STATE.md`. Agents may push `claude/*` / `gemini/*` branches and open
  pull requests (AGENTS.md hard rule 7). Gemini's extras (inspector, market drilldown, complexity
  benchmark) are kept as a clearly labelled sense-check area, or, where Claude judges a part of
  no value, documented and deleted.

## D-028 2026-10-19 — Gemini's extras become one internal /sense-check page; the international benchmark is deleted
- Agent: claude, under D-027
- Basis: this commit; files read at `057aa01`
- Context: `/inspector` held three extras: a body-type inspector (`DataInspector.tsx`), a market
  drilldown with eight tabs (`MarketDrilldown.tsx`) and an international complexity benchmark
  (`ComplexityBenchmark.tsx`). Their data (`src/data/inspector_data.json`,
  `market_intelligence.json`, `country_silhouettes.json`) was extracted from the register by hand
  on 2026-09-13 and the queries were not saved. The code hardcoded makes, models and powertrains
  (invariant #1), carried written takeaways (a non-goal), and the main charts linked into it.
- Options considered: (1) keep all of it as it was, behind a label: leaves invariant #1 broken in
  code and the commentary in place. (2) Keep the NZ figures as plain tables on one internal page,
  with every name in a data file, and delete what can't be checked. (3) Delete everything: loses
  figures that do help check the charts (body type by model, concentration by year).
- Decision: (2).
  - `/sense-check` (`src/pages/sense-check.astro`) renders 14 tables from `src/data/sense_check.json`.
    It is `noindex`, out of the main navigation, linked only from the footer and from caveat 7, and
    headed with what the data is and isn't. The page names no domain value in code.
  - The NZ figures were copied unchanged into that file (only `MAKE|MODEL` keys are shown as
    `MAKE MODEL`), with a definition for each table that says
    what was checked against the cube on 2026-10-19: powertrain December 2023 and January 2024
    within 0.5%; ute yearly totals within 3% of the Ute segment across all import statuses (the
    inspector had labelled them "new utes", which was wrong); China-owned market total and NZ-new
    make counts for 2025 within 0.1%. MAZDA BT-50 is 0 in every year, which suggests a missed model
    match.
  - Hand classifications (market segment, SUV yes/no, origin of new makes) are kept but labelled.
  - Links from `MixChart`, `LeagueChart`, the Explore page and caveat 7 into `/inspector` are gone.
- Deleted, and what it held (recover any of it with `git show 057aa01:<path>`):
  - **The international complexity benchmark** (`src/components/ComplexityBenchmark.tsx`, 1,197
    lines; `src/data/country_silhouettes.json`; the `benchmark_*`, `international_benchmark` and
    `active_brands_by_country` keys of `market_intelligence.json`). For the USA, China, Japan,
    Australia and NZ, each year 2015–2025: new-vehicle volume, number of active brands, units per
    brand, brands per million people, with a year slider and a log-scale chart. 2025 values as
    stored: USA 16.1M / 38 brands, China 32.1M / 160, Japan 4.5M / 50, Australia 1.2M / 76, NZ
    134K / 82 (NZ-new). Sources were named (BEA and NADA; CAAM and CPCA; JADA and Zenkeijikyo;
    FCAI / VFACTS; NZTA) but no retrieval was recorded. Also brand rosters per country (38, 80 of
    160, 50, 76, 82 makes), country silhouettes, a "dealership viability simulator" (cars per week
    across an eight-dealer network, with a verdict) and four paragraphs on why NZ is fragmented
    (1998 tariff removal, right-hand drive, the Clean Car Discount, multi-franchise dealer groups).
    Deleted because only the NZ figures can be checked against this project's data, the rest
    can't be traced, and the simulator and explanations are commentary. The NZ part (make counts,
    concentration, volume bands, new makes) is kept as tables.
  - The drilldown's and inspector's written takeaways ("Toyota's paradox", "Coalface Truth", the
    Ranger-vs-Hilux claim), its Observable Plot charts (the tables carry the same figures), and a
    "platform roadmap" proposing `model_segments.csv`, which is not in `POST_GATE.md`.
  - Smaller pieces not carried into the tables: the inspector's separate `ute_rivalry` extract
    (Ranger and Hilux by year, with figures that differ from `ute_timeline`, e.g. 2015 Ranger 6,122
    against 6,420, so it probably counted a different scope; not checked), each make's
    `total_all` / `total_recent` and each segment's `total`, and the volume bands' names and
    descriptions.
- Consequences: these tables can't be refreshed. If one is needed for real, rebuild it as a
  pipeline output and a preset. Whether `/sense-check` ships when the site is deployed is open.
- Status: decided by Claude (unreviewed)
